Those are samples of a little utility I did for my kids, which is my most recent python work.
They wanted a way to view 2d picture of dragons on a web site and identify if they were "drakes", "wyverns", 
"2 headed dragons" or such and I did a smalll tool that does that by comparing a given image to a master set of breed images

The "findbreedid.py" code compares a list of dragons (in xml) to a series of over 250 images on the hard drive 
and using PIL - Python Image Library - compares sizes and histograms of both images, calculating the
RMS ,i.e., the root mean square of the difference between histograms. An RMS above 30 is considered a failed match.
An RMS of 0 is an exact match.

The "listbadbreedid.py program lists all the rms errors above 0 found in the XML list of source images, 
side by side with it's closest match among the master images.  An RMS above 0 but below 30 is possible for identical 
images when the master image is saved as gif and the source image is saved as png. Other desirable low RMS values 
below 30 can happen due to updated art - adding shading or small details to the original art, or new art which 
isn't yet added to the master image table on the hard drive.

The original list of source art is scrapped from HTML from the "http://dragcave.net/" website and cleaned to proper XML
by an opensource tool, or just generated on the fly with javascript, by the user typing their "dragon codes"
